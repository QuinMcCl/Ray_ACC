# Ray
A C Ray Trace program for simple Primitives

This program uses the tiny obj loader from:
	https://github.com/tinyobjloader/tinyobjloader

The main.c files is mostly to demonstrate how to perform specific functions such as:
	Loading an obj file.
	Creating custom models from primitives.
	Moving the models around.
	Rendering several images.

The bunny.obj is not included. I got it from:
	https://casual-effects.com/data/

This website contains many more models for anyone to try and use.
